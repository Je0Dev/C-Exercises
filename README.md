A comprehensive collection of C programming solutions for the bonus exercises of the **"Programming I"** course at the University of Peloponnese, Department of Informatics & Telecommunications (Academic Year 2024-2025).

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Compile and Run

All programs are written in standard C and can be compiled with `gcc`.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Your-Username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/Your-Username/your-repo-name.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

3.  **Compile a specific file:**
    To compile a program, use the `gcc` command. For programs that use the `math.h` library (like the semiprime checker), you need to add the `-lm` flag.
    ```bash
    # Example for a simple file
    gcc -o output_program YourName_Askisi_1.c

    # Example for a file using the math library
    gcc -o semiprime YourName_math2.c -lm
    ```

4.  **Run the compiled program:**
    ```bash
    ./output_program
    ```
